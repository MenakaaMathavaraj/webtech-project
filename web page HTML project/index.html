<p>The video and actually the song I wrote it for the ladies because I know sometimes we go through relationships and they donâ€™t work out and we blame the guy or we blame the other girl or we blame ourselves. And we have this inner voice that kind of leads us in the right direction. We can always depend on ourself and the song 'Me, myself and I' and I wanted the video to reflect that. I was trying to think of something different, something fresh and new visually to do.</p>
